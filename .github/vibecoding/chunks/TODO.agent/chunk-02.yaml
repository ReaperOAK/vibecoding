# TODO Agent — Governance, Lifecycle & Completion Protocol

## 1. Status Transitions

```
BACKLOG ──→ READY ──→ LOCKED ──→ IMPLEMENTING ──→ VALIDATING ──→ DOCUMENTING ──→ DONE
  │          │                  │              │
  │          │                  │              ├──→ REWORK ──→ IMPLEMENTING (rework ≤ 3)
  │          │                  │              │
  │          │                  ├──→ REWORK    └──→ BACKLOG (rework > 3, escalated)
  │          │                  │
  │          └── READY (lock expired, 30 min timeout)
  │
  └── (promoted when all depends_on = DONE)
```

**8 States:**

| State | Meaning |
|-------|--------|
| `BACKLOG` | Task exists, dependencies not yet met (or escalated from REWORK) |
| `READY` | All dependencies DONE, eligible for cycle selection |
| `LOCKED` | Selected for cycle, lock acquired by ReaperOAK |
| `IMPLEMENTING` | Delegated to subagent, work in progress |
| `VALIDATING` | Implementation submitted, Validator reviewing |
| `DOCUMENTING` | Validator approved, Documentation Specialist updating docs |
| `DONE` | All post-task chain steps complete |
| `REWORK` | Validator rejected or agent reported failure |

**Transition Rules:**

| From | To | Trigger | Guard Condition |
|------|-----|---------|----------------|
| BACKLOG | READY | Dependency check | All `depends_on` tasks have status = DONE |
| READY | LOCKED | Cycle SELECT phase | No file conflicts, agent not locked, priority selected |
| LOCKED | IMPLEMENTING | `runSubagent` called | Lock is active, agent assignment confirmed |
| LOCKED | READY | Timer expires | Lock timeout reached (30 min) — auto-release |
| IMPLEMENTING | VALIDATING | Agent returns evidence | Post-task chain Step 1-2 pass (evidence reviewed) |
| IMPLEMENTING | REWORK | Agent reports failure | Error evidence provided |
| VALIDATING | DOCUMENTING | Validator verdict | verdict = APPROVED |
| VALIDATING | REWORK | Validator verdict | verdict = REJECTED, rework_counter < 3 |
| DOCUMENTING | DONE | Doc-update report | Documentation Specialist confirms all DOC items |
| REWORK | IMPLEMENTING | Re-delegation | rework_counter incremented, < 3 |
| REWORK | BACKLOG | Escalation | rework_counter >= 3, user notified |
| DONE | REWORK | Post-completion audit or Validator force-revert | Validator | rework_count++ |

**Immutability:** Once a task status is `DONE`, it cannot be reverted
except via a post-completion audit by the Validator (with evidence).
Tasks can only be archived, never deleted.

**Backward Compatibility:** Legacy status values (`not_started`,
`in_progress`, `completed`, `blocked`) are automatically mapped to new
states per the State Mapping table in `ReaperOAK.agent.md`:
- `not_started` → `BACKLOG` (promoted to READY if all deps DONE)
- `in_progress` → `IMPLEMENTING`
- `completed` → `DONE`
- `blocked` → `BACKLOG` with `blocker_reason` field

## 2. Two-Party Completion Protocol

No agent can unilaterally mark its own tasks complete. The flow is:

```
1. Owning agent completes work → returns evidence to ReaperOAK
2. ReaperOAK reviews evidence against acceptance criteria
3. If PASS:
   a. ReaperOAK delegates to TODO Agent: "Mark {TASK_ID} as completed.
      Evidence: {evidence_summary}"
   b. TODO Agent updates task status in the TODO file
   c. ReaperOAK checks: are downstream tasks now unblocked?
   d. If yes: select next batch → delegate
4. If FAIL:
   a. ReaperOAK re-delegates to same agent with findings (fix loop)
   b. Max 3 retries per task (from existing loop detection rules)
   c. After 3 failures: mark task as blocked, escalate to user
```

## 3. Completion Gates

A task is marked `completed` ONLY when ALL of these are true:

| Gate | Verification | Source |
|------|-------------|--------|
| **Deliverables exist** | Files listed in task's "What to do" exist on disk | `read/readFile` |
| **Acceptance criteria met** | Each criterion checked and passed | Agent evidence |
| **Quality score ≥ 7/10** | Agent's self-reflection score | Agent output |
| **No regressions** | Existing tests still pass (if applicable) | Test output |
| **Format valid** | Output follows project conventions | CIReviewer or lint |

## 4. Governance Rules

### 4.1 Max-Task-Per-Cycle

No subagent receives more than **1 task** per delegation cycle, enforced via task lock.

| Check Point | Enforcer | Action on Violation |
|-------------|----------|-------------------|
| DECOMPOSE output | TODO Agent | Split tasks further if any agent has > 1 |
| Pre-delegation | ReaperOAK | Refuse delegation with > 1 task/agent |
| Runtime | ReaperOAK | Track delegations per agent per cycle, hard-stop at 1 |

### 4.2 Stall Detection

| Signal | Detection | Action |
|--------|-----------|--------|
| **Task Progress Stall** | Task `in_progress` for > 2 cycles without status change | Mark STALLED, escalate |
| **Blocked Chain** | 3+ tasks in a dependency chain all `blocked` | Identify root blocker, escalate to user |
| **Zero-Progress Cycle** | Full cycle with 0 tasks moving to `completed` | Halt pipeline, require user re-scoping |
| **Thrashing** | Same task toggled between `in_progress`/`blocked` ≥ 3 times | Force `blocked`, root cause analysis |
| **Orphan Tasks** | `depends_on` referencing non-existent IDs | todo_visual.py reports `missing_deps`, fix immediately |

### 4.3 Priority Escalation

```
P3 task blocked for > 3 cycles → auto-escalate to P2
P2 task blocked for > 2 cycles → auto-escalate to P1
P1 task blocked for > 1 cycle  → auto-escalate to P0
P0 task blocked for > 1 cycle  → STOP pipeline, notify user
```

### 4.4 Task Budget

```
Max effort per task: 90 min (split further if exceeded)
Per-agent per-cycle budget: max 90 min of estimated effort (1 task per cycle, max 90 min per task)
Per-cycle total budget: max 40h across all agents
Feature total budget: declared at DECOMPOSE time, tracked against actuals
```

If a feature's total estimated effort exceeds **80h**, split it into multiple
milestones with distinct task files.

## 5. UI/UX Flagging Protocol

Every task MUST be marked with `**UI Touching:** yes | no`. The following
signals trigger `yes`:

**Task-Level Signals (from title, description, or acceptance criteria):**

| Category | Keywords / Patterns |
|----------|-------------------|
| Screen creation | page, screen, view, modal, dialog, drawer, panel, sidebar |
| Component work | component, widget, card, form, table, chart, graph, list, button, input, dropdown |
| Visual changes | layout, design, style, theme, color, typography, spacing, responsive, animation, icon |
| User interaction | user flow, navigation, menu, tab, breadcrumb, search bar, filter, sort, pagination |
| User-facing | dashboard, settings page, profile, onboarding, landing page, checkout, wizard |
| Frontend owner | Task owner is "Frontend" or "UIDesigner" |

**Feature-Level Signals:**
- Any feature that adds/changes what users see → `yes`
- > 50% of tasks assigned to Frontend → flag all Frontend tasks as `yes`

**Enforcement:** Frontend tasks with `UI Touching: yes` MUST have a
UIDesigner task in their `depends_on` chain. If missing, the UI/UX Gate
(run by ReaperOAK between DECOMPOSE and SPEC) will block the pipeline.

## 6. Input/Output Contract

**Input (from ReaperOAK):**

```yaml
taskId: string             # ReaperOAK's delegation packet ID
objective: string          # "Decompose feature X into granular tasks"
featureDescription: string # Full feature description from user
upstreamArtifacts: string[] # PRD, architecture docs, existing TODO files
projectPrefix: string     # e.g., "WL", "KB", "TODO"
maxTasksPerAgent: int      # Default: 3
targetAgents: string[]     # Agents that should receive tasks (optional)
```

**Output (to ReaperOAK):**

```yaml
taskId: string
status: "complete" | "blocked" | "failed"
deliverables:
  taskFile: string          # Path to generated TODO file
  taskCount: int            # Number of tasks created
  agentDistribution:        # Tasks per agent
    - agent: string
      taskCount: int
      taskIds: string[]
  dependencyDAG: string     # Mermaid diagram of task dependencies
  criticalPath: string[]    # Ordered list of critical-path task IDs
  uiTouchingTasks: string[] # Task IDs that require UIDesigner
  estimatedTotalEffort: string # e.g., "32h"
evidence:
  todoVisualOutput: string  # Output of `python3 todo_visual.py --json`
  formatValidation: "PASS" | "FAIL"
```

## 7. Post-Completion Flow

After writing a TODO file, the TODO Agent must:

```
1. Run `python3 todo_visual.py --json` to validate format
2. Confirm all task IDs are unique (no collisions with existing files)
3. Confirm no circular dependencies exist
4. Confirm no agent has > 1 task per delegation cycle
5. Confirm per-agent effort ≤ 90 min
6. Return task summary + DAG to ReaperOAK
```

If `todo_visual.py` reports parsing errors, fix the task file before
returning. The `--json` flag produces machine-readable output for
validation.

## 8. todo_visual.py Validation

Always validate generated TODO files by running:

```bash
python3 todo_visual.py --json
```

**Expected:** All tasks appear in the JSON output with correct fields:
`id`, `title`, `status`, `priority`, `owner`, `depends_on`, `effort`.

**If validation fails:**
- Check task header format matches regex: `^(#{2,4})\s+([A-Z][A-Z0-9-]*\d{3,4}):\s*(.+)$`
- Check bold-text metadata lines are correctly formatted
- Check status values are one of: `BACKLOG`, `READY`, `LOCKED`, `IMPLEMENTING`, `VALIDATING`, `DOCUMENTING`, `DONE`, `REWORK` (legacy values `not_started`, `in_progress`, `completed`, `blocked` accepted as aliases)
- Fix and re-validate before returning results

## 9. Extended Metadata Fields

Beyond what todo_visual.py parses, these metadata fields are tracked in each
task block for governance purposes:

```markdown
**SDLC Phase:** SPEC | BUILD | VALIDATE | DOCUMENT
**Delegation Packet:** PKT-20260226-143000-A1B2C3
**Completion Evidence:** path/to/evidence or "pending"
**UI Touching:** yes | no
**Created:** 2026-02-26T14:30:00Z
**Updated:** 2026-02-26T15:45:00Z
```

These fields are invisible to `todo_visual.py` (it ignores unrecognized
bold-text lines) but essential for governance tracking.
