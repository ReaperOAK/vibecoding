### **6.3 Request for Comments (RFCs)**

For proposing major changes, use the **RFC** process. An engineer writes a design doc proposing a change, circulates it for async feedback, and then iterates. This democratizes architectural input and ensures decisions are vetted by the collective intelligence of the team.49

**Part VII: The CTO’s Pre-Code Checklist & Learning Roadmap**

### **7.1 The CTO Pre-Code Checklist**

Before a single line of production code is written for a new project/startup:

**Strategy & Product:**

* \[ \] **Validate the Problem:** Is there a PRD defining the "Why" and "What"? 1  
* \[ \] **Define Success:** Are there clear, measurable KPIs? 1  
* \[ \] **Scope Boundaries:** Is "Out of Scope" explicitly defined? 1  
* \[ \] **Buy vs. Build:** Have we checked if this is a commodity we can buy? 2

**Architecture & Tech Stack:**

* \[ \] **One-Way Doors:** Have we rigorously debated the language, cloud, and database choices? 4  
* \[ \] **System Design:** Is there a TDD with High-Level Architecture, ERDs, and API Contracts? 1  
* \[ \] **Data Strategy:** Do we have a plan for data ownership and schema migration? 16

**Process & Quality:**

* \[ \] **Repository:** Monorepo or Polyrepo? (Default to Monorepo for \<50 engineers) 14  
* \[ \] **Branching:** Is Trunk-Based Development established? 21  
* \[ \] **CI/CD:** Is there an automated pipeline for testing and deployment? 1  
* \[ \] **Linting/Style:** Are code standards enforced by tooling, not arguments? 50

**Security & Compliance:**

* \[ \] **Auth:** Are we using a standard identity provider (e.g., Auth0) instead of building our own?  
* \[ \] **Secrets:** Are secrets managed securely (e.g., Vault, AWS Secrets Manager) and not checked into git?  
* \[ \] **Compliance:** Do we meet basic regulatory needs (GDPR, SOC2 readiness)? 50

### **7.2 The Engineering Leader’s Learning Roadmap**

**Foundational Leadership:**

* *The Manager's Path* by Camille Fournier (Transitioning from IC to Lead).51  
* *An Elegant Puzzle* by Will Larson (Systems of engineering management).52

**Architecture & Design:**

* *Team Topologies* by Matthew Skelton & Manuel Pais (Org design as architecture).29  
* *Accelerate* by Nicole Forsgren et al. (The science of DevOps metrics).53  
* *Designing Data-Intensive Applications* by Martin Kleppmann (The bible of distributed data).

**Staff+ Engineering:**

* *Staff Engineer: Leadership Beyond the Management Track* by Will Larson.52  
* *The Staff Engineer's Path* by Tanya Reilly.54

**Operational Excellence:**

* *Site Reliability Engineering* (Google SRE Book).55  
* *The Phoenix Project* (DevOps culture novel).53

**Conclusion**

The transition from a coder to a CTO is a shift from manipulating variables to manipulating systems. The code is the easy part. The challenge lies in building the "machine that builds the machine"—the organizational structure, the culture of quality, the decision-making frameworks, and the strategic alignment that allows a group of humans to create software that is greater than the sum of its parts. By adhering to this playbook—grounded in rigorous specification, architectural simplicity, automated quality, and intentional organizational design—a technical leader can navigate the chaos of scaling and build a lasting engineering institution. The goal is not just to write code, but to engineer a business that endures.
