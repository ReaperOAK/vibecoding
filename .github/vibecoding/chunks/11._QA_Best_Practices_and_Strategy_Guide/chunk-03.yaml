5. **Verification:** With the feature live in a production-like environment, the automated **End-to-End (E2E)** test suite is triggered to validate critical user journeys. Concurrently, **Manual QA** engineers perform exploratory, usability, and negative testing to uncover issues that automation would miss.  
6. **Defect Management:** All bugs discovered are logged in the designated tracking system (e.g., Jira). They are then prioritized, assigned to developers, fixed, and deployed back to staging for re-verification.  
7. **Approval:** Once the feature has met all the pre-defined **exit criteria** in the Test Plan (e.g., all critical tests passed, no outstanding high-severity bugs), the build is formally marked as **"QA Approved"** and is ready for release.  
8. **Feedback Loop:** As a final step, for any significant bugs found during manual testing, new automated tests are created and added to the regression suite. This ensures the system is continuously strengthened and the same bug cannot reappear undetected.

### **B. Cultivating a Culture of Quality Across the Engineering Team**

The most advanced and effective QA processes are those that are embedded within the culture of the entire engineering organization.

* **Quality is a Shared Responsibility:** Quality cannot be the sole responsibility of a separate QA team. It must be a core value shared by everyone. This means developers take ownership of the quality of their code through comprehensive unit testing and rigorous peer code reviews. It means product managers are responsible for writing clear, unambiguous, and testable acceptance criteria for every user story.5 When quality is a collective goal, defects are prevented proactively rather than being found reactively.  
* **Data-Driven Improvement:** A mature QA process is a measurable one. Teams should track key metrics such as **defect leakage rate** (bugs found in production), **test execution time**, and **change failure rate** (the percentage of deployments that cause a failure).5 These metrics should not be used for blame but as objective data to identify bottlenecks, analyze trends, and continuously refine the development and testing process.3  
* **The Primacy of the Feedback Loop:** Ultimately, the entire Verification and QA process can be viewed as a complex system designed to achieve one primary goal: to provide fast, accurate, and actionable feedback to developers.46 The shorter and more reliable this feedback loop, the faster a team can iterate, innovate, and deliver high-quality software to its users. The success of any QA strategy is best measured not by the number of tests run, but by the quality and speed of this critical feedback loop.45
