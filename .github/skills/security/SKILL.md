# Security Engineering

## When to Use
- Performing security reviews on code
- Conducting STRIDE threat analysis
- Scanning for OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities
- Implementing agentic security guardrails

## Key Practices
1. **STRIDE Analysis** — Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information Disclosure, Denial of Service, Elevation of Privilege
2. **OWASP Top 10** — Injection, Broken Auth, Sensitive Data, XXE, Broken Access, Security Misconfiguration, XSS, Insecure Deserialization, Vulnerable Components, Insufficient Logging
3. **Secrets Management** — Never hardcode, use environment variables or secret managers
4. **Input Validation** — Sanitize all user inputs, validate against schemas
