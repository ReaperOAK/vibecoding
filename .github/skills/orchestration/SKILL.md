# Orchestration Rules

## When to Use
- Dispatching agents for parallel execution
- Coordinating multi-agent workflows
- Resolving dependencies between tickets
- Managing agent handoffs

## Key Rules
1. **One Agent Per Ticket** — Each ticket gets exactly one worker per stage
2. **Parallel Execution** — Independent tickets can be processed simultaneously
3. **Dependency Resolution** — tickets.py handles dependencies, not agents
4. **Handoff Protocol** — Context flows via filesystem summaries only

## Resources

- Cross-cutting protocols reference
- Orchestration rules (chunk-01, chunk-02)
