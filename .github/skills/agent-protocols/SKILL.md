# Agent Protocols

## When to Use
- Configuring new agents in the multi-agent system
- Understanding boot sequence requirements
- Implementing dispatcher-claim protocol
- Enforcing scoped git rules and evidence requirements

## Key Protocols
1. **Boot Sequence** — All agents must read STOP_ALL, instructions, chunks, catalog, upstream summary, and ticket JSON before work
2. **Context Derivation** — Agents derive context ONLY from filesystem (ticket JSON, previous summaries, codebase files)
3. **Forbidden Actions** — No `git add .`, no force push, no cross-ticket modifications
4. **Evidence Requirements** — Every completion claim must include artifact paths and confidence level
