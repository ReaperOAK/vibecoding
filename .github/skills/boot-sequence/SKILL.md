## Overview

Required boot sequence all agents must execute before starting work. Reads guardian file, instruction files, agent definition, upstream summaries, and context chunks.


# Boot Sequence

Every agent must execute this boot sequence before any work:

1. **Read Guardian**: Check `.github/guardian/STOP_ALL` — if contains `STOP`, halt immediately
2. **Read Instructions**: Load all files in `.github/instructions/`
3. **Read Agent Definition**: Load `.github/agents/{YourAgent}.agent.md`
4. **Read Upstream Summary**: Load `agent-output/{PreviousAgent}/{ticket-id}.md` (if exists)
5. **Read Context Chunks**: Load `.github/vibecoding/chunks/{YourAgent}.agent/` (all files)
6. **Read Catalog**: Load `.github/vibecoding/catalog.yml` and task-relevant chunks
7. **Plan Execution**: Map steps and identify tools before touching any files

## Halt Conditions

- If `STOP_ALL` contains `STOP`: zero edits, zero execution, report blocked
- If instruction files conflict: halt and report `NEEDS_INPUT_FROM: Human`
