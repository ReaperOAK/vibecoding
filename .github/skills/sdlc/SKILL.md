# SDLC Enforcement

## When to Use
- Validating ticket stage transitions
- Enforcing Definition of Done (DoD)
- Managing rework cycles
- Governing the SDLC pipeline

## Definition of Done (10 Items)
1. All acceptance criteria implemented
2. Tests written (≥80% coverage for new code)
3. Lint passes (zero errors, zero warnings)
4. Type checks pass
5. CI passes
6. Docs updated (JSDoc/TSDoc, README if applicable)
7. Validator independently reviewed
8. No console errors (structured logger only)
9. No unhandled promises
10. No TODO comments in code

## Rework Rules
- Maximum 3 combined rework attempts per ticket
- After 3 reworks → ESCALATED to human
- Rework re-enters at implementation stage with rejection evidence
