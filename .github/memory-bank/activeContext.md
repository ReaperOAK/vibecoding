## Session Notes

<!-- Per-session working notes. Append only. -->

### [2026-02-21] Session 1

- Initialized vibecoding multi-agent system
- Completed Phase 1 (intelligence sweep), Phase 2 (architecture design),
  Phase 3 (memory bank)

### [2026-02-23] Session 2

- Integrated Claude Code as a vibecoding agent alongside GitHub Copilot
- Created CLAUDE.md, .claude/settings.json, hooks, and slash commands
- Full dual-agent support now operational
### [2026-02-24] Sessions 3-5 — Context Bloat Fix

- Completed all 11 hardening phases (A-K): subagent files, orchestration rules,
  security guardrails, chunk system, catalog, cross-cutting protocols,
  guardian, locks, sandbox, observability, hooks, workflows
- Created boot files: `.github/copilot-instructions.md` (45 lines) +
  `agents.md` at repo root (80 lines) — auto-load chain for all sessions
- User deleted `.github/instructions/` folder — chunks are sole source of truth
- Cleaned `catalog.yml` of stale references to deleted instruction files
- **Context bloat diagnosed:** agent files were 585-1,052 lines each, consuming
  too much context window, preventing delegation behavior
- **All 12 agent files slimmed** (total: 7,787 → 826 lines, ~89% reduction):
  - ReaperOAK: 1,052 → 84 lines
  - Architect: 666 → 61 | Backend: 711 → 68 | Frontend: 716 → 64
  - QA: 774 → 66 | Security: 769 → 65 | DevOps: 780 → 69
  - Documentation: 807 → 68 | Research: 704 → 68 | ProductManager: 585 → 67
  - CIReviewer: 614 → 65 | _cross-cutting-protocols: 493 → 81
- Each slim file preserves: YAML frontmatter, identity, scope, ALL forbidden
  actions (safety-critical), key protocols as summary table, chunk pointer
- Backups of all originals at `.bak` files in `.github/agents/`

### [2026-02-25] Session 6 — Force Delegation

- ReaperOAK still self-implementing instead of delegating — root cause: agent
  file said "Self-execute quick tasks (< 5 min)" which the model used as escape
  hatch to do everything itself
- Rewrote ReaperOAK.agent.md (84 → 102 lines) with CARDINAL RULE section:
  "YOU DO NOT IMPLEMENT" — zero self-implementation, mandatory parallel
  delegation via `runSubagent`
- Explicit whitelist of what ReaperOAK MAY do (read files, memory bank, git
  status) vs what it MUST delegate (all code, tests, docs, architecture, etc.)
- Added delegation workflow: Read → Plan → Delegate (parallel) → Validate →
  Report
- Reinforced in `agents.md` boot file: "ReaperOAK is a PURE ORCHESTRATOR"

### [2026-02-26] Session 7 — Cross-Agent Communication

- Tested Kanban build: ReaperOAK successfully delegated to 4 agents in parallel
  but (a) did all the thinking itself (architecture, API contracts, DB schema)
  instead of letting Architect do it, (b) agents couldn't see each other's
  output — Backend didn't read Architect's contracts, QA didn't read Backend's code
- **Root cause:** No dependency model — all agents launched flat in parallel with
  specs baked into the prompt by ReaperOAK, bypassing domain expertise
- **Fix: Phased Delegation with File-Based Handoff**
  - ReaperOAK now uses dependency phases (SPEC → BUILD → VALIDATE → DOCUMENT)
  - Within each phase: all agents run in parallel (no cap)
  - Between phases: ReaperOAK validates, then launches next phase
  - Each phase's files on disk become the next phase's input
  - Delegation prompt template now includes "Upstream artifacts" field
- All 10 subagent MANDATORY FIRST STEPS updated: step 3 = "Read upstream
  artifacts listed in delegation prompt BEFORE starting"
- Cross-cutting protocols: added §6 "Cross-Agent Communication (File-Based
  Handoff)" — agents must read upstream, align with prior contracts, write
  clean deliverables, and stop+report if upstream is missing
- **Next:** Fresh ReaperOAK session, re-test with Kanban prompt — expect phased
  execution with Architect/PM first, then Backend/Frontend/DevOps, then QA/Security

## Session 8 — Self-Improving System Migration (2025-07-25)

### Current Focus
- Completed full migration to self-improving multi-agent architecture
- All 6 subsystems designed and implemented

### Changes Made
1. **Shared Context Layer** — Created workflow-state.json, artifacts-manifest.json, feedback-log.md in memory bank
2. **UIDesigner Agent** — New agent with Google Stitch integration, Playwright visual validation, component specs
3. **Self-Improvement System** — Proposals directory, RETROSPECTIVE phase, auto-reject rules
4. **ReaperOAK Upgrade** — 6-phase SDLC (added RETROSPECTIVE), state management obligations, proposal handling
5. **Schema Extensions** — Delegation packet: phase, upstream_artifacts, mcp_grants, fix_loop_context, output_contract fields
6. **Architecture Update** — ARCHITECTURE.md v4.0.0 with UIDesigner, shared context layer, §18 self-improvement
7. **Catalog + ACL** — UIDesigner entries in catalog.yml, tool-acl.yaml, design: tag

### Validation Results

### Architecture Document
- Full design at `docs/architecture/self-improving-system.md` (1,466 lines)

## Session 9 — TODO Agent & Execution Governance (2025-07-26)

### Current Focus
- Fixed two architectural flaws: (1) UIDesigner not invoked when required, (2) subagents attempted monolithic execution instead of granular tasks
- New TODO Agent created for task decomposition
- SDLC upgraded from 6-phase to 7-phase (DECOMPOSE added as Phase 0)
- UI/UX Gate enforces UIDesigner invocation for all UI-touching work

### Changes Made
1. **TODO Agent** — New agent (13th) for granular task decomposition, L2 autonomy, constrained terminal access
2. **DECOMPOSE Phase** — New Phase 0 in SDLC: ReaperOAK delegates to TODO Agent before SPEC
3. **UI/UX Gate** — Mandatory check between DECOMPOSE and SPEC, keyword detection, requires UIDesigner tasks for UI work
4. **TODO-Driven Delegation** — Max 3 tasks/cycle (5 for SPEC), task-driven delegation with specific IDs
5. **Loop Detection** — 4 new signals: TODO stall, zero-progress cycle, blocked dependency chain, max-task-per-cycle violation
6. **Architecture Update** — ARCHITECTURE.md v4.1.0 with §10.1 UI/UX Enforcement Gate
7. **Security Hardening** — runInTerminal constrained to `python todo_visual.py`, allowlist write scope, memory bank write access removed

### Validation Results
- QA: CONDITIONAL PASS → 2 MEDIUM + 1 LOW findings
- Security: CONDITIONAL PASS → 1 HIGH + 3 MEDIUM + 3 LOW findings
- Fix loop 1: All HIGH + MEDIUM findings resolved (5 fixes applied)
- Post-fix verification: All fixes confirmed

### [2026-02-26T00:00:00Z] ReaperOAK — Session 10

- **Focus:** SDLC Enforcement Upgrade — production-grade task lifecycle
- **Status:** COMPLETE
- **Pipeline:** DECOMPOSE → SPEC → BUILD (4 cycles) → VALIDATE → GATE → FIX LOOP (1 iter) → RE-VALIDATE → DOCUMENT
- **Agents Used:** TODO, Architect, Backend (×5), QA Engineer, Security Engineer, Documentation Specialist

### Problem Statement
6 identified weaknesses: no strict test→validate loop, bugs caught late, no initialization enforcement, Frontend bypassing UIDesigner, no Definition of Done, no mandatory validation gates.

### Changes Made
1. **7-Stage Task-Level SDLC** — Inner loop within BUILD phase: PLAN → INITIALIZE → IMPLEMENT → TEST → VALIDATE → DOCUMENT → MARK COMPLETE. Hard gates between every stage.
2. **Validator Agent** — 14th agent (L2 autonomy), independent SDLC compliance reviewer. Can reject task completion. Read-heavy, write only to docs/reviews/. 14 forbidden actions.
3. **Definition of Done Template** — 10 items (DOD-01 to DOD-10) with evidence requirements, machine-parseable format, Validator-enforced.
4. **Initialization Checklist** — 9 items (INIT-01 to INIT-09) with frontend/backend/fullstack conditional applicability. Blocks IMPLEMENT if incomplete.
5. **8-Layer Bug-Catching Strategy** — G1-G3 at IMPLEMENT, G4-G5 at TEST, G6-G8 at VALIDATE. Pass/fail criteria per gate.
6. **Governance Architecture** — State machine, blocking rules, rework loops (max 3 → user escalation).
7. **5 New Loop Detection Signals** — SDLC Stage Skip, DoD Non-Compliance, Initialization Skip, UI/UX Gate Bypass, Validator Rejection Loop.
8. **STOP_ALL Keyword Fix** — Standardized on `STOP` keyword across agents.md and Validator.agent.md.
9. **Documentation Agent Write Scope** — Denied writes to docs/reviews/** to prevent Validator report tampering.

### Validation Results
- QA: FAIL → Fix Loop 1 (3 CRITICAL + 2 HIGH fixed) → Re-VALIDATE: PASS
- Security: PASS_WITH_FINDINGS (3 MEDIUM, 4 LOW — no CRITICAL/HIGH)
- Fixes applied: C1 (init field alignment), C2 (design doc INIT items), C3 (template paths), H1 (autonomy L2), H2 (model name), M1 (STOP keyword), M2 (doc agent scope), L1 (schema hardening)

### Files Created (8)

### [2026-02-27T00:00:00Z] Ticket-Driven Event-Based Engine (Session 13)

- **Focus:** Complete orchestration model replacement — phase-based → ticket-driven
- **Agent:** ReaperOAK
- **Scope:** TDSA-BE001 through TDSA-DOC001 (7 tasks, all DONE)

### Key Changes
- **ReaperOAK.agent.md** — COMPLETE REWRITE (833→810 lines). 20 sections. Ticket-driven event loop replaces phased model. 9-state machine: BACKLOG → READY → LOCKED → IMPLEMENTING → REVIEW → VALIDATED → DOCUMENTED → COMMITTED → DONE. Mandatory per-ticket post-execution chain: QA → Validator → Doc → CI Reviewer → Commit. Event emission protocol (9 types). Anti-one-shot guardrails. Commit enforcement per ticket.
- **TODO.agent.md** — Updated (133→175 lines). Ticket Compatibility section added. L3 tasks = tickets entering BACKLOG. 9-state backward compat mapping.
- **_cross-cutting-protocols.md** — Updated (102→209 lines). Section 8: Event Emission Protocol (9 event types, structured payloads). Section 9: Anti-One-Shot Guardrails (scope enforcement, 2-pass minimum, anti-batch detection).
- **agents.md** — Updated (200→191 lines). Boot protocol references ticket-driven event loop, 9-state machine, post-execution chain, event emission §8, anti-one-shot §9.
- **chunk-01.yaml** — Updated (315→324 lines). Format A default BACKLOG, 9-state values, ticket model notes. Hash: PENDING_RECOMPUTE.
- **chunk-02.yaml** — Updated (297→306 lines). 9-state model replaces 8-state. Post-execution chain aligned. Governance rules updated. Hash: PENDING_RECOMPUTE.
- **ARCHITECTURE.md** — Updated v6.0.0→v7.0.0 (1044→1194 lines). Full ticket-driven architecture documented.

### Validator Review
- All 7 checks PASSED at 95% confidence (V1-V7)
- Advisory: 8+ out-of-scope files still reference old model (Validator.agent.md, loop-detection-rules.md, delegation-packet-schema.json, etc.) — technical debt for future ticket

### What to Do Next
- Create remediation ticket for out-of-scope files referencing old model
- Recompute chunk hashes for chunk-01.yaml and chunk-02.yaml
- Update workflow-state.json and artifacts-manifest.json

## Session 15 — Operational Integrity Protocol (OIP) v1.0.0

**Date:** 2026-03-01
**Objective:** Implement self-healing governance layer for Light Supervision Mode (Model B)

### Current Focus
Implementing OIP v1.0.0 — 7-part protocol upgrade from v8.1.0 to v8.2.0:
1. Core Invariants (9 non-negotiable rules)
2. Automatic Drift Detection (7 violation types: DRIFT-001 to DRIFT-007)
3. Auto-Repair Workflow (ComplianceWorker pool, targeted single-action repair)
4. Scoped Git Enforcement (no git add . / -A / --all, explicit file staging)
5. Parallel Backfill Stream (Stream A execution + Stream B retroactive repair)
6. Memory Enforcement Gate (5 required fields, blocks COMMIT without entry)
7. Continuous Health Sweep (5 checks per scheduling interval)
8. Light Supervision Mode (auto-correct drift, human only for strategy)

### Changes Made

**ReaperOAK.agent.md** — v8.1.0→v8.2.0 (1454→1863 lines, +409). Added §19-§26 (OIP core). Renumbered §19-§22→§27-§30. ComplianceWorker pool in §7. PROTOCOL_VIOLATION + REPAIR_COMPLETED events in §13. Health Sweep in §9 scheduling loop.

**ARCHITECTURE.md** — v8.1.0→v8.2.0 (1961→2092 lines, +131). §33 OIP overview (6 subsections). §5.1 health sweep in scheduling loop. §8.1 two new events. §8.3 two routing entries. §10.4 scoped git. §15.2 memory gate.

**_cross-cutting-protocols.md** — (245→339 lines, +94). §11 OIP cross-cutting rules (7 subsections: events, scoped git, memory, evidence, single-ticket, ComplianceWorker, health sweep awareness).

**agents.md** — (238→292 lines, +54). §6 OIP memory enforcement. §9 OIP reference section (scoped git, memory gate, single-ticket, evidence, ComplianceWorker, health sweep).

### OIP-ARCH-001 — ReaperOAK.agent.md OIP Core

## Session 16 — Structural Hardening v9.0.0

### Current Focus
Completed 7-part structural hardening upgrade: unlimited elastic workers, governance hierarchy, modular context injection.

### SH-001 — Governance Policy Files
- **Artifacts:** .github/governance/lifecycle.md, worker_policy.md, commit_policy.md, memory_policy.md, ui_policy.md, security_policy.md, event_protocol.md, context_injection.md, performance_monitoring.md
- **Decisions:** 9 policy files extracted from ReaperOAK §§, each under 250-line limit
- **Timestamp:** 2026-03-01T02:00:00Z

### SH-002 — Core Governance Authority
- **Artifacts:** .github/agents/_core_governance.md
- **Decisions:** Canonical authority file indexes all governance policies; version tracking in governance files only (NOT agent frontmatter)
- **Timestamp:** 2026-03-01T02:10:00Z

### SH-003 — ReaperOAK Transformation
- **Artifacts:** .github/agents/ReaperOAK.agent.md
- **Decisions:** Rewritten from scratch: 1864→723 lines (61% reduction), 24 sections, zero maxSize/minSize, governance references replace inline policy
- **Timestamp:** 2026-03-01T02:20:00Z

### SH-004 — Agent Normalization
- **Artifacts:** (no file changes — reverted per user constraint)
- **Decisions:** Agent .agent.md YAML frontmatter is OFF-LIMITS for custom fields; governance version tracked exclusively in governance files
- **Timestamp:** 2026-03-01T02:30:00Z

### SH-005 — Boot Protocol Update
- **Artifacts:** agents.md
- **Decisions:** Added governance authority subsection (§3), unbounded pool language (§4), updated OIP references (§9)
- **Timestamp:** 2026-03-01T02:40:00Z

### SH-006 — Cross-Cutting + Architecture
- **Artifacts:** .github/agents/_cross-cutting-protocols.md, .github/ARCHITECTURE.md
- **Decisions:** ARCHITECTURE.md v9.0.0 with unbounded pools, governance hierarchy in §19, DRIFT-008/009 in §33. Cross-cutting §8.1+§11 updated.
- **Timestamp:** 2026-03-01T02:50:00Z

### SH-007 — Catalog Update
- **Artifacts:** .github/vibecoding/catalog.yml
- **Decisions:** Added governance: tag with all 10 governance file paths
- **Timestamp:** 2026-03-01T03:00:00Z

### What to Do Next
- Rechunk ReaperOAK.agent.md (was 3 chunks for 1864 lines, now 723 lines — may need 2)
- Update ARCHITECTURE.md chunks if stale
- Verify all agent chunk files still align with new governance references
- Run full system test with real ticket execution
- Consider adding OIP worked example (§31) to ReaperOAK.agent.md
